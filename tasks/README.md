# YuDi Time Tracker - Task Breakdown

This directory contains all task documentation for the YuDi Time Tracker project. Tasks are organized into phases that build upon each other, ensuring each task is self-sufficient and testable.

## Task Organization

Tasks are numbered sequentially and grouped into phases:

- **Phase 1**: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
- **Phase 2**: Domain Models & Database
- **Phase 3**: Shared Components & Utilities
- **Phase 4**: UI Screens & Core Features
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Features & Polish

## Task Naming Convention

Tasks follow the format: `TASK-XXX-description.md` where XXX is a three-digit number.

## Task Dependencies

Each task document includes:
- **Dependencies**: List of prerequisite tasks
- **Description**: What needs to be implemented
- **Expected Outcome**: What should be visible/testable
- **Testing Approach**: How to verify the task is complete

## Development Workflow

1. Complete tasks in order (respecting dependencies)
2. Each task should have its own commit
3. All tests must pass before marking a task complete
4. Update task document with any issues or notes
