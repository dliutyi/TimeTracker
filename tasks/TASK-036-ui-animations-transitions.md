# TASK-036: UI Animations & Transitions

## Phase
Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish

## Dependencies
All UI tasks

## Description
Add smooth animations and transitions throughout the app. Implement page transitions, button animations, list animations, and other UI polish. Ensure animations are performant and enhance UX.

## Expected Outcome
- Smooth animations throughout app
- Page transitions implemented
- Button animations working
- List animations working
- Loading animations
- Error state animations
- Performance is good

## Implementation Details
1. Implement page transitions:
   - Screen transitions
   - Tab transitions
   - Modal transitions
   - Route transitions
   - Custom transitions

2. Implement button animations:
   - Press animations
   - Loading states
   - Success states
   - Error states
   - Hover effects (if applicable)

3. Implement list animations:
   - Item insertions
   - Item removals
   - Item updates
   - List reordering
   - Staggered animations

4. Implement loading animations:
   - Skeleton loaders
   - Progress indicators
   - Shimmer effects
   - Spinner animations

5. Implement micro-interactions:
   - Icon animations
   - Feedback animations
   - Gesture animations
   - State change animations

6. Optimize performance:
   - Use appropriate animation curves
   - Avoid jank
   - Test on lower-end devices
   - Use hardware acceleration
   - Optimize animation duration

7. Test animations:
   - Test on different devices
   - Test with different themes
   - Test accessibility
   - Test performance

## Testing Approach
- Test all animations
- Test on different devices
- Test performance
- Test accessibility
- Test with different themes
- Get user feedback

## Notes
- Don't over-animate
- Ensure animations are meaningful
- Consider user preferences
- Test on various devices
- Consider reduced motion preferences
